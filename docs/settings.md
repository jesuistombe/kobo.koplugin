# Settings

The Kobo Plugin provides comprehensive settings to control how the plugin operates, particularly
around reading state synchronization between KOReader and Kobo.

## Settings Categories

### Sync Settings

Control how and when reading progress is synchronized between KOReader and Kobo's native reader:

- **[Sync Settings Overview](./settings/sync-settings-overview/index.md)** - Core settings for
  enabling and configuring sync
- **[Sync Direction Settings](./settings/sync-direction-settings.md)** - Detailed control over sync
  behavior in each direction
- **[Sync Configuration Examples](./settings/sync-configuration-examples.md)** - Common
  configuration patterns for different use cases

## Accessing Settings

1. Open KOReader file browser
2. Open the menu (top-left corner)
3. Select "Kobo Library" → Settings

All settings are stored in KOReader's configuration and persist across restarts.
