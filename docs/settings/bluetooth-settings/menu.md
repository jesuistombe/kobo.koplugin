- Bluetooth menu is only visible on MTK-based Kobo devices (Libra Colour, Clara BW/Colour)
- "Configure key bindings" only appears when a device is connected
- When Bluetooth is enabled, the device will not enter standby mode
- The device will still suspend or shutdown according to your power settings
- "Scan for devices" scans for nearby Bluetooth devices. Use it to discover new devices to pair and
  to check whether previously paired devices are currently nearby and discoverable.
