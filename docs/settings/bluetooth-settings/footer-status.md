# Footer Status

## Overview

The "Show status in footer" feature displays Bluetooth status in the reader's footer bar. This
allows you to see at a glance whether Bluetooth is enabled or disabled while reading, without having
to open menus.

## Enabling Footer Status

1. Go to Settings → Network → Bluetooth → Settings
2. Toggle "Show status in footer" to enable or disable the feature

## How It Works

When footer status is enabled:

- An icon or text appears in the reader's footer bar showing Bluetooth status
- The display adapts based on your footer settings:
  - **Icons mode**: Shows 󰂯 (Bluetooth on) or 󰂲 (Bluetooth off)
  - **Compact items mode**: Shows 󰂯 (Bluetooth on) or 󰂲 (Bluetooth off)
  - **Text mode**: Shows "BT: On" or "BT: Off"
- The status updates automatically when you enable or disable Bluetooth
- If "hide empty generators" is enabled in footer settings and Bluetooth is off, the indicator may
  be hidden

## Default Behavior

The footer status feature is **enabled by default**.
