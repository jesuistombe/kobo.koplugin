## Overview

KOReader stores reading progress in "sidecar" files alongside each book. These are Lua table files
that contain the reading position, status, and other metadata.

Unlike Kobo's centralized database, KOReader uses a distributed approach where each book has its own
metadata file. The plugin reads from these files to push progress to Kobo, and writes to them when
pulling progress from Kobo.
